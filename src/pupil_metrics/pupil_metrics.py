"""
Metrics:
- Peak pupil-size in specified time window
- Peak latency: time between critical point in task (such as stimulus onset) and peak dilation
- Mean dilation in specified time window
- Dilation slope: steepness of increase in pupil-size in specified time window
- Intra-trial change in pupil-size
- Inter-trial change in pupil-size
