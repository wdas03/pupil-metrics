"""
Ajasse et al., 2018:

- The mean pupil size and pupil size variance computed for each fixation period (i.e., in-between two positioning saccades).
- The latency of the start of a constriction: the time between the end of a positioning saccade to the first inflection point computed on pupil signal (see aforementioned and Figure 2).
- The postsaccadic dilation amplitude: the difference of pupil size at saccade end and the beginning of constriction.
- The constriction amplitude, computed as the difference of pupil size at the beginning and the end of a constriction, defined by the inflection points computed on the pupil signal.
- The latency of the end of the pupil constriction: the time between the positioning saccade and the second inflection point.
- The constriction velocity, defined in percentage of baseline per second: the constriction amplitude divided by the time between the first and the second inflection points of the pupil signal.
- The quality of fixation: the percentage of the time during which the gaze position was inside a spatial window of 1Â° centered on the target disks.
